# Olympic High Jump Gold Medal Winning Heights

The London 2012 event was won by Ivan Ukhov of Russia.  However, on February 1, 2019, Ukhov was stripped of the gold medal by the Court of Arbitration in Sport for doping offences.

At the time of collating this dataset, the medals have not yet been reallocated. However, Erik Kynard's 2.33m silver medal jump has been entered for the men's event on the assumption that this will be
the final allocation.
