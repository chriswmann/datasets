Tonnage,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
Background,,,,,,,
Both nationally and internationally there are different measures of tonnage. The historic measure has been Gross Registered Tonnage (GRT). ,,,,,,,
"The European Union has been progressively moving to a common standard for measuring tonnage, a volumetric measure known as Gross Tonnage (GT) as defined in International Tonnage Convention 1969.",,,,,,,
"A phased programme of conversion has been introduced by the Commission, with different procedures being applied to the 2 tranches of the 15 metre and over fleet, as follows:",,,,,,,
1,Vessels of 27 metres overall length and above were required to be re-measured according to ITC69. A number of UK vessels have yet to meet this requirement.,,,,,,
2,Vessels of between 15 metres and 27 metres overall length are required to be re-measured according to ITC69 by 2004.,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
The tonnage figures expressed across the over 10 metre fleet are therefore a mixture of GRT and GT.,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
Further Fleet Statistics are available in the 2015 edition of the UK Sea Fisheries Statistics publication. ,,,,,,,
